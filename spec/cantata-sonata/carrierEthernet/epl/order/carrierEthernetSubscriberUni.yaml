    MEF LSO Cantata-Sonata - Carrier Ethernet Subscriber UNI (Order) Product Specification

description:  >-
    The Subscriber UNI Service Attributes values are agreed to
    by the Subscriber and the Service Provider to describe the behavior
    of the UNI. All of these Service Attributes can be modified after
    initial provisioning of the UNI except the components of the List
    of Physical Links and Link Aggregation-related attributes.

        description:  >-
            MEF 10.4 §9.2 - When the value is Physical, the UNI is implemented
            using one or more instances of a standard Physical Layer. When
            the value is Virtual, the physical layer is not specified.
        type: string
        enum:
            - "PHYSICAL"
            - "VIRTUAL"
    virtualFrameMap:
        description:  >-
            MEF 10.4 §9.2 and §9.3 - When the value of the Subscriber UNI
            Instantiation Service Attribute = Virtual, there must exist a map
            that maps the set of Virtual Frames that cross the UNI to a sequence
            of pairs of the form 〈s,t〉 where s is a standard Ethernet frame
            per Clause 3 of IEEE Std 802.3 – 2015 [5] and t is the arrival
            time at the UNI for all bits in s. Since MEF 10.4 does not specify
            the contents or format of this map, it is currently defined as
            an arbitrary length string.

    listOfPhyLinks:
        description:  >-
            MEF 10.4 §9.4 - The value of the Subscriber UNI List of Physical
            Links Service Attribute is a list of 5-tuples of the form <id,
            physicalLink, synchronousEthernet, precisionTiming, demarcConnectorType>,
            with one list item for each physical link. The value of id is an
            identifier for the physical link. The value of physicalLink is
            the specific Ethernet physical layer type. synchronousEthernet
            indicates if synchronous Ethernet is used on the physical link
            and has the value Enabled or Disabled. The value of precisionTiming
            indicates if the Precision Time Protocol is used on the physical
            link and has the value Enabled or Disabled. The value of demarcConnectorType
            specifies the type of connector used. Note that the id and the
            physicalLink come from the CarrierEthernetPhysicalLink class.

            NONE-No Link Aggregation is used. 2_LINK_ACTIVE_STANDBY-The SP
            network uses Link Aggregation as in either Clause 5.6.1 of IEEE
            Std 802.1AX-2008 [2] or Clause 6.7.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AX-2014 with
            one Link Aggregation Group(LAG) across the links supporting the
            UNI/ENNI such that all Service Frames are carried on only one of
            the two links when both links are operational. ALL_ACTIVE-The SP
            Network uses Link Aggregation as specified in Clause 5.3 of IEEE
            Std 802.1AX-2014, including the use of the version 2 LACPDUs as
            specified in Clause 5.3.1h of IEEE Std 802.1AZ-2014, with one Link
            Aggregation Group (LAG) across the links. OTHER-The Operator/Subscriber/Service
            Provider agree on another other resiliency mechanism.
