    **This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to
    change.** 


    The scope of this MEF API is to provide the ability for a Service Provider's
    (Buyer)

    operational support system to retrieve from a Partner's (Seller) Inventory
    management

    system a set of product instances based upon a filter of product inventory
    attributes,

    or a specific product instance based upon a product identifier.


    Product Inventory API has been designed by MEF basing on TMF 637 v4.0.0

            MEF 10.4 sec. 9.2 and sec. 9,3 - When the value of the Subscriber
            UNI Instantiation Service Attribute = Virtual, there must exist a
            map that maps the set of Virtual Frames that cross the UNI to a
            sequence of pairs of the form?s,t where s is a standard Ethernet
            frame per Clause 3 of IEEE Std 802.3 2015 [5] and t is the arrival
            time at the UNI for all bits in s. Since MEF 10.4 does not specify
            the contents or format of this map, it is currently defined as an
            arbitrary length string.
